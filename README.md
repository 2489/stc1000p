STC\-1000+
========

Improved firmware for fermentation and Arduino based uploader for the STC-1000 dual stage thermostat.

The STC-1000 is a dual stage (heating and cooling) thermostat that is pretty cheap to buy. I (and a low of fellow homebrewers) use them to control the fermentation temperature of beer.

The goal of this project is twofold
 * To create the means to reprogram the STC-1000 with a custom firmware
 * To create a custom firmware, suited for fermenting beer

The first goal is achieved by using an Arduino UNO with a sketch to act as a programmer, and the second by using the SDCC compiler and GPUTILS.
