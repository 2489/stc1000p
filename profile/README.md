Profile editor and sketch generator
===================================

The profile editor and sketch generator, is a simple web page that does not rely on any server side communication. It can thusly be used directly from your computer by opening the *hextabbed.html* file with your browser.
The page is also [hosted here](https://goo.gl/z1KEoi) for use directly off the internet.

The purpose of the page, is to be able to edit the possible settings that can be made for the different fimware versions, preview it graphically (well, currently not for the one vessel brew system controller version of the firmware, but still) and on the fly generate the sketch needed to upload the firmware and the settings to the STC-1000.
